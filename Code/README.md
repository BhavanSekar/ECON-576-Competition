1) All the files in this folder except "ECON_Competition_Submission" must be downloaded into the same directory with consistent naming for the code to run. This exception is because this is the output generated by the code and not the pre-requisite.
2) The Code file contains data preprocessing steps, three algorithms and the predicted test/validation sale prices for the three algorithms.
3) Lasso Regression gives the best r2 of 0.9124 on the local test set.
4) The r2 on the actual unseen validation/test set once the model is trained with the whole available training sample/full dataset must be around 91.5%.
5) The salepricedata.csv dataset is the same as the train dataset available in original_files folder. This is master dataset for modelling as the original test set i.e., test_val.csv does not have the target variable in it.
6) The test_val.csv is same as the test.csv availble in original_files. This is not used for model tuning. It is used only for final prediction.
7) The output generated by the code contains an excel file of the predicted sale price. "ECON_Competition_Submission" is the file name. The same file can be found in output_for_submission folder on the main branch.
