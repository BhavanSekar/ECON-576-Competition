1) All the files in this folder must be downloaded into the same directory with consistent naming for the code to work.
2) The Code file contains data preprocessing steps, two algorithms and the predicted test/validation sale prices for the two algorithms.
3) CNN gives the best r2 of 0.875 on the local test set.
4) The r2 on the actual unseen validation/test set once the model is trained with the whole available training sample/full dataset must be around 88-89.
